# Income_Classifer
This application predicts whether a person's annual income is above 50K(USD) or not, this application is exposed as an API using both FastAPI & Flask, and we have deployed the flasked based api to GCP and link of that app is [here](https://income-classifier.el.r.appspot.com/)


Also there is a sample help document on FastAPI,please find it inside the repo. I have also attached the dataset used for this machine learning based app in the repo.
